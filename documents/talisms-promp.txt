This is a php 8.3 composer project which is a library/framework to serve APIs.
the project is constructed from several folder which consists the framework and library and several folders consisting a small example app built on top of the TalisMS project and also show how the folders of a real app should look like.
Below I bundledI all the files in this project into one large file.
Each section, within the tags TalisDemoApp, TalisFramework, TalisDoor represents a file in the big context file
The frameworkw/lib files which are the most important are encapsulated as follows:
<TalisFramework path="/relative/path/to/root/project">
[file content]
</TalisFramework>

The demo application files are encapsulated as follows:
<TalisDemoApp path="/relative/path/to/root/project">
[file content]
</TalisDemoApp>

One part of the framework/lib is a folder called "doors". The files in this folder are the various entry points to the app. Cli/cron/js/http/rest etc.
These files are encapsulated in:
<TalisDoor type="[deducted from the file name and code within]" path="/relative/path/to/root/project">
[file content]
</TalisDoor>
